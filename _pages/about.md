### Research area

Microbial populations sustain the balance of geochemistry and life in the ocean by driving the transfer, recycling and exportation of matter and energy. Yet, long-​standing questions in microbial ecology and evolution remain to be addressed. I am interested in deciphering the relative importance of gene expression modulation and adaptation of marine microbes. Specifically, I study how these two processes -​acting at the individual or population level-​ shape the structure and function of microbial communities. For this purpose, I use bioinformatic tools to analyze environmental metagenomes and metatranscriptomes. This will help to better understand the short and long-​term response of marine microbes to a changing environment.
